## doorsigns
-1. find a linux computer ;_; mac is so sad for gimp (aka go to an athena cluster)
0. download gimp if you don't already have it.
1. download the ult-doorsigns.py file!
2. create a file new-smite-names.txt and put it somewhere
3. make a directory where the doorsigns end up
4. update lines 68,69 of the python file to the appropriate locations 
5. move the file to the appropriate gimp plugins folder! (google this if you need to) actually, try looking at this [installation page](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GIMP/Installing_Plugins "Installing Plugins"). 
6. download old-template.xcf (for new members) or new-template.xcf (for returners).
7. open the xcf in gimp!
8. under image > scripts there should be a door signs script.
9. run it!
10. yay all your doorsigns should be donezo :)
11. steps should be fairly similar for the doorsigns for returners!
